Benchmarking
============

This section describes the steps to run the benchmarking workflow using Snakemake.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Make sure you have Snakemake installed. If not, you can install it using:

  conda install -c bioconda -c conda-forge snakemake

- Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. Snakemake will automatically create and manage the required environments based on the defined rules.

Steps
-----

1. Download the required SIF image by running the following command:

   bash download_sif.sh

   This script will download the SIF image needed for the benchmarking workflow.

2. Generate the config file required by the Snakemake workflow by running the following command:

   bash generate_sample_config.sh

   This script will generate the necessary config file for the Snakemake workflow.

3. Set the `CORE_NUM` variable to the number of CPU cores you want to use:

   CORE_NUM=64

   Replace `64` with the actual number of CPU cores available on your system.

4. Run the Snakemake workflow using the following command:

   nohup snakemake --cores $CORE_NUM --profile snakemake_profile &> benchmark.log &

   This command will:
   - Run Snakemake in the background using `nohup`.
   - Use the specified number of CPU cores (`$CORE_NUM`).
   - Use the specified Snakemake profile (`snakemake_profile`).
   - Redirect the standard output and standard error to `benchmark.log`.

5. Monitor the progress of the workflow by checking the `benchmark.log` file:

   tail -f benchmark.log

   This command will display the last few lines of the log file and update in real-time.

6. Once the workflow finishes, the benchmarking results will be generated and saved in the designated output directory.

Note: Make sure you are in the directory where the benchmarking workflow is located before running the commands.
