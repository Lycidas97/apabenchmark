Extracting Non-Overlapping Peaks
================================

This section describes the workflow for extracting non-overlapping peaks using Snakemake.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Make sure you have Snakemake installed. If not, you can install it using:

  conda install -c bioconda -c conda-forge snakemake

- Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. Snakemake will automatically create and manage the required environments based on the defined rules.

Steps
-----


1. Set the `CORE_NUM` variable to the number of CPU cores you want to use:

   CORE_NUM=64

   Replace `64` with the actual number of CPU cores available on your system.

2. Run the Snakemake workflow using the following command:

   nohup snakemake --cores $CORE_NUM --use-conda &> benchmark.log &

   This command will:
   - Run Snakemake in the background using `nohup`.
   - Use the specified number of CPU cores (`$CORE_NUM`).
   - Create and use conda environments for each rule (`--use-conda`).
   - Redirect the standard output and standard error to `benchmark.log`.

3. Monitor the progress of the workflow by checking the `benchmark.log` file:

   tail -f benchmark.log

   This command will display the last few lines of the log file and update in real-time.

4. Once the workflow finishes, the non-overlapping peaks will be extracted and saved in the designated output directory.
