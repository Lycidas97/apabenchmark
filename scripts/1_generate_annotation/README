Generating PAS and A-SNR Annotations
====================================

This section describes how to generate the necessary PAS (Polyadenylation Site) and A-SNR (Alternative Splicing-Noise Ratio) annotations for analysis.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.

- Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. The necessary environment is defined in `scripts/envs/apasim.yml`.

Steps
-----


1. Activate the `apasim` environment:

   conda activate apasim

   If you haven't created the environment yet, you can create it using:

   conda env create -f scripts/envs/apasim.yml

2. Install `ipykernel` in the `apasim` environment:

   conda install ipykernel

3. Register the `apasim` environment with Jupyter Notebook:

   python -m ipykernel install --user --name apasim

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   jupyter notebook

5. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, open the `mouse_pas_integration.ipynb` script and run all cells to generate PAS annotations.

6. Open the `filter_pas.ipynb` script and run all cells to filter the PAS annotations.

7. Open the `get_asnr.ipynb` script and run all cells to generate A-SNR annotations.

8. When finished, close the Jupyter Notebook interface and deactivate the `apasim` environment:

   conda deactivate

The generated annotation files will be saved in the designated output directory and can be used for subsequent analysis.
