# APA Benchmark

This repository contains the code and datasets used in the study "Benchmarking alternative polyadenylation detection in single-cell and spatial transcriptomes".

## Overview

Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a widespread post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism that generates mRNA isoforms with diverse 3' UTRs and terminal exons. This study systematically compares seven 3'-tag-based sequencing protocols and six computational tools for their ability to detect APA events in single-cell and spatial transcriptomes.

## Contents

- `data/`: Contains the datasets used in the study, including simulated and real data from various sequencing protocols.
- `scripts/`: Contains the scripts used for data processing, analysis, and evaluation of APA detection tools.
- `results/`: Contains the output files and figures generated during the analysis.
- `docs/`: Contains additional documentation and supplementary materials.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Lycidas97/apabenchmark.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies as specified in the documentation.

3. Run the scripts in the `scripts/` directory to reproduce the analysis and generate the results.

4. Refer to the documentation in the `docs/` directory for detailed information on the datasets, methods, and usage of the scripts.
